		**C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO**

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used for organizing and managing data.

They have distinct characteristics and are commonly used in various algorithms and applications.

Here's a brief overview of stacks and queues:

**Stacks:**

	- Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, 
	which means that the last item inserted is the first one to be removed.
	- Think of a stack as a vertical stack of objects where you can only access or modify the topmost item.
	- The operations supported by a stack are:
	  - Push: Adds an item to the top of the stack.
	  - Pop: Removes the topmost item from the stack.
	  - Peek or Top: Retrieves the topmost item without removing it.
	- Stacks are often used in scenarios that involve tracking function calls, managing recursion, 
	undo/redo operations, and evaluating expressions, among others.

**Queues:**

	- Queues follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, 
	which means that the first item inserted is the first one to be removed.
	- Imagine a queue of people waiting in line, where the person who arrived 
	first is the first one to proceed.
	- The operations supported by a queue are:
	  - Enqueue: Adds an item to the end of the queue.
	  - Dequeue: Removes the item from the front of the queue.
	  - Peek or Front: Retrieves the item from the front of the queue without removing it.
	- Queues are commonly used in scenarios that involve handling requests, managing processes, 
	scheduling tasks, breadth-first search, and more.

Both stacks and queues can be implemented using various programming languages, 
     such as C. In C, you can use arrays or linked lists to implement these data structures. 
     Arrays provide a fixed-size implementation, while linked lists allow dynamic resizing.

It's worth noting that there are other variations and extensions of stacks and queues, 
	such as double-ended queues (deques) and priority queues, which have additional 
	features to support operations from both ends or prioritize elements based on certain criteria.
